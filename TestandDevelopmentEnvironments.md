# Introduction #
The code is developed using [Eclipse PDT](http://www.zend.com/community/pdt/downloads) using [ZEND Debugger](http://www.zend.com/community/pdt/downloads) on Windows Server 2008 R 2 Web Server Edition Service Pack 1.

The server is running:
  * PHP 5.3.13
  * MySQL 5.1.63
  * SQL Server Express 2012, and Microsoft PHP 3.01 drivers for SQL

There are two installs of Moodle 2.3.1, one utilising MySQL and one SQL Server.

The code is tested during development on these two configurations.

Further testing is then performed using:
