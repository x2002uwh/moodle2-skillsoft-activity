# Introduction #
When troubleshooting "Track to OLSA" and using Moodle 2.3+ you can download and add the diagnostics reports.

**NOTE: These are provide to assist in diagnosing issues, and are not designed for reporting use of the Skillsoft Assets. This is still done using the standard Moodle reports**

These reports provide access via the Moodle Admin UI to:
  1. List of all the Custom Report Synchronisations
  1. List all of the usage data records imported from the Custom Report Synchronisations
  1. List all of the TDR usage data records imported from the "On Demand Communications" Synchronisations

## Installation ##
